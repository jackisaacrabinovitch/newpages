00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,430
Hello, my name is Jack Rabinovitch, and this
is my poster presentation: "Two Ways to Existentially

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,980
Close a Proposition".

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,119
Linguists often distinguish root clauses from
embedded clauses, where root clauses may exist

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,220
independent of other clauses in a sentence,
and embedded clauses are only grammatical

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,960
in embedded contexts.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,210
The differences between these two clauses
is not only in their distribution but also

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,290
in the phenomena they exhibit.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,720
While root clauses allow discourse markers
and fronting of certain arguments, embedded

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,679
clauses often do not, and are typically marked
with a complementizer.

10
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,530
However, this distinction is fuzzy, considering
that many languages embed clauses with root

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,230
phenomena - so called embedded root phenomena
- or have independent clauses with embedded

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,170
phenomena - so called insubordination.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,690
While embedded clauses are often thought of
as representing propositions, full sentences

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,690
are speech acts.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,309
In this presentation, I argue that root phenomena
is in part caused by the presence of speech

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,040
act semantics, accompanied by an additional
syntactic domain above the CP.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,700
In Ibero-Romance languages, speech act embedding
results in both embedded root phenomena and

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,120
insubordination.

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,410
Since Searle (1969), it has generally been
thought that propositions and speech acts

20
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,340
are distinct ontologically.

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,320
Propositions are functions from worlds to
truth values, while speech acts are 'turns'

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,390
in a communicative game.

23
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,200
Speech acts consist of a sentence radical,
typically a proposition, and an illocutionary

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,880
force, which type shifts the sentence radical
into a speech act.

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,820
Syntactically this is reflected in Speas and
Tenny (2003)'s split of the left periphery

26
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,830
into a lower propositional domain and a higher
speech act domain.

27
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,560
The speech act domain hosts illocutionary
material such as discourse particles and vocatives,

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,500
which are thus restricted to the far left
- or right - of a sentence, as in (5).

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,920
Material in the speech act domain seems to
not be truth conditional, such as evidentials,

30
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,450
which often fail dissent tests.

31
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,090
In (6), while a respondent can directly challenge
whether or not InÃ©s visited her sister, they

32
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,410
cannot challenge the evidential force given
by the reportative particle that the speaker

33
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,220
was told this.

34
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,720
Faller (2002) argues that this is because evidentials
effect sincerity conditions rather than truth

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,130
conditions: while a proposition is true when
it accurately represents the state of affairs

36
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,740
in the world of evaluation, a speech act is
sincere when it accurately represents the

37
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,980
state of mind of the speaker in the given
context.

38
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,959
Following Corr (2016) I use Utterance Phrase
or UP to refer to the syntactic projection

39
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,630
of the speech act domain, while I reserve
CP for the propositional domain.

40
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,300
Thus while CP material is truth conditional,
UP material is sincerity conditional, with

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,190
the application of illocutionary force in
the ForceP acting as an interface between

42
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,700
the two.

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,540
Root phenomena such as the placement of discourse
markers are thus only possible when sincerity

44
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,720
conditional speech act semantics, accompanied
by the UP syntax, are present.

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,280
This way of splitting the CP and UP domains
ontologically closely mirrors Ramchand and

46
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,460
Svenonius (2014)'s analysis of the differences between
the vP, TP, and CP domains.

47
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,580
For them, the vP, TP, and CP are sortal domains,
meaning that they are distinguished from one

48
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,450
another by the ontological sort which is represented
and modified in each domain.

49
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,590
Events are represented and modified in the
vP, situations in the TP, and propositions

50
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,099
in the CP.

51
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,690
The domains have a strict syntactic hierarchy
because the sorts have a strict cognitive

52
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,060
hierarchy, where each sort is an elaboration
of the sort below it.

53
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,820
Domains are separated by interfacing heads
which introduce the higher sort argument,

54
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,760
relate the higher sort to the lower sort,
and existentially close the lower sort.

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,910
This can be seen in (10), where the vP is
an event-taking predicate whose event 'e'

56
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,860
argument is related to a situation 's' via
an aspectual relation before being closed

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,940
off.

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,300
The resulting Aspect Phrase has an open situation
argument which can then undergo predicate

59
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,800
modification with the situation-taking predicate
of a T-head, becoming a situational TP.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,970
We can extend this theory into the UP domain,
and introduce speech acts as a sort, cognitively

61
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,380
'above' propositions, with a force relation
as an interface relating the lower propositional

62
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,100
sort 'p' to the higher act sort 'a'.

63
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,870
Thus we can mirror the structure in (10) as
in (11), where the CP represents a proposition-taking

64
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,020
predicate which combines with Force-head to
become an act-taking predicate, which can

65
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,590
then combine with discourse markers in U-head
positions.

66
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,070
The entire sortal 'spine' of a clause can
thus be seen in (12) with four sorts and three

67
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,090
interfacing heads between them.

68
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,070
This allows us to compositionally construct
the sincerity conditions given by a speech

69
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,090
act.

70
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,930
In (13), the proposition 'it is raining' (in
green), combines with an assertive force (in

71
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,030
purple), which for our purposes creates a
sincerity condition that the embedded proposition

72
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,900
is believed by the speaker.

73
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,100
The resulting ForceP undergoes predicate modification
with a discourse marker 'alas' (in yellow),

74
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,860
which restricts the sincerity conditions such
that it is sincere if the speech act expresses

75
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,040
sadness.

76
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,820
Thus the truth conditions of 'alas, it is
raining' is that it is raining, while the

77
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,570
sincerity conditions are that the speaker
believes it is raining, as given by the assertive

78
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:32,060
force relation, and that the speaker is sad
about it, as given by the entry of 'alas'.

79
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,020
Under a Kratzerian framework, attitude verbs
are unable to directly embed propositions,

80
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,320
and instead take entity-type arguments with
propositional content.

81
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,080
Complementizers (as denoted in light blue),
function to type shift propositions into entities

82
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,290
via a compatibility relation as in (14).

83
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:59,340
The relation 'small-caps Comp' is true of
a proposition 'p' and an entity 'x' if 'x'

84
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,780
refers to a proposition 'p-sub-x' with the
same truth conditions as 'p'.

85
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,080
Because propositions of the same truth conditions
can be said to be the same proposition, this

86
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,740
effectively means that 'x' refers to the proposition
'p', or that the entity 'x' has the propositional

87
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,420
content of 'p'.

88
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,140
For Kratzer, complementizers are two place
predicates, as in (14c).

89
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,550
For a Ramchand and Svenonius framework, complementizers
can be seen as a sort of interfacing head

90
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,960
between propositions and entities.

91
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,720
In this way, a complementizer introduces an
entity argument, relates the entity to a proposition,

92
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,580
and then existentially closes the propositional
argument, as in (14d).

93
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,350
Either way, a complementizer headed CP will
be an entity-taking predicate, which can then

94
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,560
restrict the entity argument of a verb as
in (15), where 'know' takes an entity argument,

95
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,990
which is restricted to having the propositional
content of 'it is raining' by the embedded

96
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,960
CP.

97
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,560
The application of complementizers and illocutionary
force are two ways to existentially close

98
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,560
propositions, each relating them to a different
sort; entities for complementizers, and speech

99
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,280
acts for illocutionary force.

100
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,040
Because they both close off the proposition,
they are not stackable within the same clause.

101
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,680
The root phenomena that occurs due to the
presence of a UP domain thus cannot occur

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,790
under a complementizer, restricting root phenomena
to root clauses.

103
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,400
Likewise, assuming that all independent clauses
are of a speech act type, root clauses cannot

104
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,580
be headed by a complementizer or exhibit other
embedded phenomena.

105
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,800
However, as we can see in (16), some languages,
such as Spanish, do embed speech acts.

106
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,880
(16a) embeds a proposition, and thus the clause
'who was coming' is evaluated with respect

107
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,699
to the world: Juan is reported as saying the
list of people such that they were coming.

108
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:48,840
(16b) which has the inserted 'que', however,
reports Juan saying not the list of people,

109
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,280
but a question, a request for knowledge of
who was coming.

110
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,070
The embedded speech phrase here is thus a speech
act with illocutionary force, rather than

111
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,200
a proposition available for truth conditional
evaluation.

112
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,919
Similar to the Kratzerian complementizer,
we can understand 'que' in reportative contexts

113
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,990
to be a relational head between speech acts
and entities.

114
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,009
Rather than a compatibility relation, I propose
the existence of the analagous suitability

115
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,009
relation.

116
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:20,380
In (17b), 'small caps Suit' is true of a speech
act 'a' and an entity 'x' if the 'x' refers

117
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,860
to a speech act 'a-sub-x' such that 'a-sub-x'
and 'a' have the same sincerity conditions.

118
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,319
Thus a 'que' embedded speech act refers to
the sincerity conditions of some specific

119
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,010
speech act which the speaker is referencing.

120
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,060
The referent need not be the actual embedded
utterance, it may be a speech act uttered

121
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,080
in the past or an imagined speech act, spoken
by the current speaker, or someone else, and

122
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,060
it need not be verbatim, as long as the sincerity
conditions of the embedded speech act 'a'

123
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,029
and the referenced speech act 'a-sub-x' are
the same.

124
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:59,320
Thus, 'que' takes a speech act-taking predicate
UP, opens up an entity argument, relates the

125
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,620
entity and speech act via a suitability relation, and existentially
closes the speech act argument, resulting

126
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,120
in a entity-taking predicate available for
selection by a verb just like the complementizer

127
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,340
headed CP in (15).

128
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,200
Importantly, because the suitability relation
is evaluated as true or false, it is truth

129
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,620
conditional.

130
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,500
Thus, one can derive truth conditions from
an embedded speech act, not from its force

131
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,230
- evidential or otherwise - directly, but
in how its force represents the sincerity

132
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,950
conditions of the speech act which the entity
argument refers to.

133
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,029
For (18), the sincerity conditions of the
embedded commanding speech act are not evaluated

134
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:43,480
with respect to the utterance context, but
rather serve as a representation of the sincerity

135
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,700
conditions of the speech act which Juan said.

136
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,890
Thus the sentence is true if Juan said some
'x' with the sincerity conditions 'a' of a

137
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,570
command telling someone to do their task.

138
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,770
Interestingly, these effects also help to
explain insubordination.

139
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:06,649
In Spanish, insubordinative phrases come in
the form of sentences which begin with 'que'.

140
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:11,870
These sentences carry a reportative flavor,
such as (19a), where the speaker asserts news

141
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,100
about their favorite sports team with the
evidential flavor that they know it because

142
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,160
they were told this information.

143
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,200
Etxepare (2010) argues that in these cases,
'que' headed phrases represent an entity which

144
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,170
undergoes silent predication.

145
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,470
Thus, insubordination in Spanish is effectively
the same as its equivalent embedded root phenomena,

146
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,360
with a speech act related to an entity via
'que'.

147
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,350
In embedded root phenomena, this entity is
predicated overtly, in insubordination, it

148
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,200
is predicated covertly.

149
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,070
Like the embedded command in (18), the evidential
force of an insubordinative clause is embedded

150
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,470
under a suitability relation, meaning that
it's sincerity conditions are not evaluated

151
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,410
in the utterance context, and that it is truth
conditional, and thus able to be directly

152
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,070
challenged as in (19b), where the respondent
denies the evidential force that the speaker

153
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,470
was told the information.

154
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:09,070
This is unlike Quechua example in (6), as shown below, where the evidentiality is part of the matrix speech

155
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,649
act, not embedded under a suitability relation,
and thus not available for dissent.

156
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:18,680
This can be seen in (20) where the Reportative
feature in Quechua exists outside the domain

157
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,120
available for truth conditional evaluation.

158
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,420
Ibero-Romance languages, however, also have
instances of insubordination which do not

159
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:34,060
have embedded equivalents, such as exclamations
which are unable to embed under verbs, but

160
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,870
may follow discourse markers at the beginning
of a clause, such as in (21).

161
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,420
Though this can be explained by silent predication,
Searle's analysis of exclamations in English

162
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,880
may give us an alternative.

163
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,360
Searle argues that the sentence radical of
an exclamation is not propositional, but is

164
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,800
instead an entity, which has some relation
to the speech act itself.

165
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,460
For example, in (22), 'hurrah' is a speech
act predicate which additionally takes an

166
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,050
entity argument.

167
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,160
The relationship between speech act and entity
is not mediated by a force relation, and thus

168
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,399
does not relate a proposition to the speech
act.

169
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,350
Thus these speech acts do not have any truth
conditions.

170
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,500
As a result, exclamations cannot undergo dissent
of any kind.

171
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,820
Because 'que' phrases represent entities,
a discourse marker like 'ai' in Galician may

172
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,340
act similarly to 'hurrah', and take the embedded
UP not as a speech act predicate,

173
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,220
but rather as an entity predicate, closed
by 'que'.

174
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,120
Thus 'ai' denotes exasperation at an entity,
and while this entity may refer to an individual

175
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,970
like you or me, the entity in (21) refers
to a speech act.

176
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,880
Thus (21) does not assert any proposition,
but rather expresses exasperation at a given

177
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,850
speech act, or as I take it, the implied prospect
of uttering said speech act.

178
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,260
This speech act has the sincerity conditions
that the speaker believes that the addressee

179
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,270
thinks the speaker 'has all day'.

180
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:06,110
Thus the speaker presents the embedded speech
act as something they may be sincere in saying

181
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,010
while expressing their exasperation that it
may be warranted in being said.

182
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,149
In this case, the speaker is annoyed that
the addressee may think the speaker 'has all

183
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:21,930
day', and without directly committing to saying
so, the speaker expresseses that they feel

184
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,339
justified in asserting it, and quite annoyed
by that fact.

185
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,029
The translation - and source text punctuation
- is appropriately that of a rhetorical question,

186
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,080
which also implies that the speaker is justified
in asserting something without explicitly

187
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,520
asserting it.

188
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,960
Switching to another language family, Hooper
and Thompson (1973) introduced an analysis

189
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,690
of Germanic embedded root phenomena, whereby
embedded V2 clauses are asserted as part of

190
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,160
the illocutionary force of a sentence.

191
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,089
For instance (24) does not only assert one's
commitment to the belief of Max snoring, but

192
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:57,149
also asserts Max's snoring itself.

193
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:01,120
This gives it a stronger sense of commitment
than an equivalent sentence with verb final

194
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
word order.

195
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,620
The inclusion of assertion as part of the
embedded clause would make embedded verb final

196
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,970
clauses propositional, and embedded V2 clauses
speech acts.

197
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:15,899
However, the Hooper and Thompson analysis
is distinct from my analysis in that Hooper

198
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,310
and Thompson argue that embedded force is
asserted as part of the utterance force, while

199
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,730
the suitability relation I propose does not
assert the embedded force as part of the utterance

200
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:31,220
force, but rather references some other (past
or imagined) speech act with that force.

201
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,380
Again, the Spanish embedded commands and question
we have so far seen are not evaluated as commands

202
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,760
or questions in the utterance context, but
represent the sincerity conditions of some

203
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,040
referenced speech act.

204
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,240
Furthermore, recent work such as Wiklund et
al (2009) and DjÃ¤rv (2019) has pushed

205
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,880
back on the Hooper and Thompson analysis,
and argue that embedded V2 expresses that

206
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,640
information is discourse new, rather than
asserting the embedded proposition.

207
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,160
There are quite a few differences between
embedded root phenomena in Ibero-Romance and

208
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,060
Germanic languages that hint that Germanic
embedded root phenomena is constrained to

209
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,510
the propositional domain.

210
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:15,240
The first is that Germanic embedded root phenomena
can occur under verbs like 'believe' which

211
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,600
are generally assumed to not embed speech
act content.

212
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,670
This is the case in Spanish, which bans embedded
root phenomena under 'believe' and 'know'.

213
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,990
Second, negation can affect the grammticality
of embedded root constructions in Germanic

214
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,880
languages, which hints that the semantic selection
is not reliant on a difference between two

215
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,100
different sorts, but rather a difference in
the availability for discourse new information

216
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,960
to exist in affirmative and negative contexts.

217
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,980
Third, the suitability relation forces an
embedded speech act to represent the sincerity

218
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,140
conditions of a referenced speech act, which
has a specific instance of being spoken.

219
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,089
It seems that, for Germanic languages, the
embedded V2 clause does not need to reference

220
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:03,019
a specific instance of speech, thought, or
belief but can instead be more generic, referencing

221
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,649
general thoughts or beliefs that an individual
holds.

222
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:11,760
Altogether, while the addition of a UP seems
promising for embedded root phenomena in Ibero-Romance

223
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,130
languages, it does not hold up when applied
to Germanic languages.

224
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,430
Corr argues that Ibero-Romance languages differ
in what kind of 'que' clause embedding they

225
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,720
allow due to differences in feature bundling
or splitting.

226
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,300
For example, Portuguese allows 'que' exclamation
constructions but not reportative constructions.

227
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,600
Corr argues that this is because Portuguese
bundles its declarative and evidential features,

228
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,560
disallowing 'que' to attach at Evidential-head
without blocking illocutionary force from

229
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,140
the Force-head, as they are both on the same head.

230
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,420
Galician and Spanish split these features
across different heads, allowing question

231
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,230
and commanding ForcePs to embed under an evidential
'que'.

232
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,899
If this is the general cause of embedded root
phenomena across the UP, then it may also

233
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,889
be the case for embedded root phenomena in
the CP.

234
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:04,339
Thus we may be able to unite Ibero-Romance
and Germanic embedded root phenomena as both

235
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,980
caused by feature splitting, allowing more
heads for lexical generation and movement,

236
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,280
with differences between languages explained
by the differences in splitting across both

237
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,080
the UP and CP domains.

238
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,640
Today, I have presented an analysis of speech
acts a sort belonging to a sortal domain in

239
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,580
the same vein as Ramchand and Svenonius.

240
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,000
This domain is represented by the syntactic
projection of the Utterance Phrase, which

241
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,669
is distinguished from the CP by the introduction
of illocutionary force.

242
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:35,749
Complementizers and illocutionary force are
two ways to existentially close off propositions,

243
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:39,970
causing complementizer based embedding to
exhibit 'embedded' phenomena, and clauses

244
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:45,379
with illocutionary force, most commonly seen
in matrix clauses, to exhibit 'root' phenomena.

245
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:51,039
However, UP embedding is possible, and can
result in both embedded root phenomena and

246
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,389
insubordination, as is seen in Ibero-Romance
languages.

247
00:17:54,389 --> 00:18:01,190
Finally, I discussed Germanic embedded V2,
providing evidence that this form of embedded

248
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,850
root phenomena is constrained to the CP domain.

249
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,950
Finally I suggest that the feature scattering
effects in the UP of Ibero-Romance may have

250
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,049
a CP analogue responsible for embedded verb
second in Germanic languages.

251
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,229
Thank you very much for listening.
