1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:06,109
Old Chinese is often reconstructed as being
a toneless language, with syllable final segments

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:10,100
called "post-codas", which diachronically
caused tonal contours before disappearing,

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,800
resulting in the contrastive tone we see in
Middle and modern Chinese.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,280
However, as the written record of Chinese
is logographic, it is difficult to pinpoint

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,480
the exact time that tonogenesis occurred.
While rhyming categories can be reconstructed

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,500
from poetry, evidence for the presence or
absence of post-codas in a given text is sparse.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,999
Gunkel and Ryan (2015) argues that high ranking
phonological constraints cause marked word

8
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:35,790
order. Shih and Zuraw (2017) demonstrates
that violations of the obligatory contour

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,610
principle, or OCP are avoided through variation
in noun-adjective word order in Tagalog.

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,250
The presence of post-coda segments at word
boundaries in a given Chinese text would affect

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,730
cross-word OCP violations. If cross-word OCP
avoidance causes word order variation as it

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,800
does in other languages, then a given text
should reflect the presence or absence of

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,760
post-codas through the frequency of OCP violations.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,200
A text written when post-codas were present
should avoid bigrams which have a post-coda

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,890
followed by a featurally similar initial segment,
while a text written after tonogenesis occurred

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,830
would not, instead avoiding similar coda-initial
clusters regardless of what the original intervening

17
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,210
post-coda was.

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,220
In this study, I look at five classical Chinese
texts, two of which are compilations of poetry.

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,800
The study assumes that one of three hypotheses
is true: the Atonal Hypothesis assumes that

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,160
post-codas are present in the text and effect
OCP violations. The Non-Glottal hypothesis

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,020
assumes the same, with the addendum that glottal
stop post-codas are transparent to OCP effects.

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,500
And the Tonal Hypothesis assumes that tonogenesis
has occurred and post-codas are not present,

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,780
thus not influencing OCP violations.

24
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,840
For bigrams which lack an intervening post-coda
segment, this study finds that cross-word

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,210
OCP violations are significantly higher than
predicted through randomization for poetry,

26
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,880
suggesting that variation in word order is
effected by OCP violations in poetic Classical

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,160
Chinese.

28
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,330
When considering bigrams which would have
an intervening post-coda segment before tonogenesis,

29
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,731
OCP effects in poetry are significant when
assuming the presence of post-codas, but are

30
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,600
borderline when assuming their absence.

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,520
Post-codas come in two flavors, as s /s/ and
glottal-stop /ʔ/, and could co-occur with

32
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,360
nasal and glide codas. The glottal-stop /ʔ/
post-coda caused a rising tone in its syllable,

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,200
while the s /s/ post-coda lead to a falling
tone. These post-codas later underwent elision

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,450
and the resulting rising and falling tone
syllables were distinguishable from their

35
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,970
level tone counterparts by tone alone, as
can be seen in (8), where through tonogenesis,

36
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,900
the words rén 壬 ‘ninth’ and rèn
妊 ‘pregnant’ form a minimal pair with

37
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,232
level tone in the former and falling tone
in the latter.

38
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:42,900
The elision of post-codas would cause different
bigrams to violate OCP constraints; (9) shows

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,320
that the bigram fàngxīn 放心 forms a pseudogeminate
when post-codas are present, but does not

40
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,790
when they are absent, and vice versa for the
bigram fàngyuè 放月.

41
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,030
When deciding between candidates, a high ranking
OCP constraint may cause the speaker to use

42
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,569
non-canonical word order or word choice. As
shown in (10) and (11), the difference in

43
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,959
pressures across pre- and post-tonogenesis
Chinese would result in different surface

44
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,430
realizations, and different bigram distributions.

45
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,160
To find these OCP violations in the corpus,
I use Zhèngzhāng (2003)'s reconstruction.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,599
Because glide codas are difficult to distinguish
from vowels, they are considered non-codas

47
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,980
for the purpose of this study.

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,750
As shown in (12), a character may correspond
to multiple initials or codas and post-codas;

49
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,990
bigram types are found as the unique combination
of first character coda readings and second

50
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,820
character initial readings.

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,440
Expected frequency of a given bigram type
in a text is calculated as the frequency of

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,740
a given coda type multiplied by the frequency
of a given initial type.

53
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,800
Initials and codas are grouped by place and
manner of articulation. Given bigrams whose

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,650
first word coda or second word initial belong
to multiple groups are excluded from the study.

55
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,400
Which group a coda belongs to depends on the
hypothesis that we follow, with post-codas

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,420
having varying transparency across hypotheses.

57
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,800
Because they lack post-coda segments in Old
Chinese, píng and rù tones are the same

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,909
across all hypotheses. For an initial test,
bigrams which had shǎng or qù tone readings

59
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,129
for their first-characters are ignored.

60
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:08,739
Chi-squared χ2 tests were performed on each book.
These tests found that cross-word OCP violations

61
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:13,680
occured significantly less often than predicted
in the two poetry books, as well as the Commentary

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,019
of Zuo or Zuǒzhuàn, the largest prose
text. In addition, the Classic of Mountains

63
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,100
and Seas or Shānhǎi Jīng had contradicting
borderline results suggesting the opposite,

64
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,210
that OCP violations were sought out.

65
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,919
This can be seen in the first bar of each
group in the figure below, where the dot represents

66
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,100
the expected rate as given through randomization.

67
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,650
When testing for all bigrams, including those
with shǎng or qù first character readings,

68
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,360
the poetry and Zuǒzhuàn show significant
cross-word OCP effects for all hypotheses,

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,240
though these results are borderline for poetry
under the tonal hypothesis. This hints that

70
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,160
post-coda segments were present as late as
the texts were written, for parts of the Songs

71
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:55,340
of the South, according to Tz’ù and Hawkes
(1959), this would be as late as the Han Dynasty

72
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,910
- circa 200 BCE to 200 CE.
