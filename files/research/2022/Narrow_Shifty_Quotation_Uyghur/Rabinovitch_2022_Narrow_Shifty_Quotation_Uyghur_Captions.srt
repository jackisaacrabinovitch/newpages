00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,640
Hi, I'm Jack and welcome to my talk.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,360
In languages with indexical shift, it can be difficult to distinguish indexically shifted complements from quotation.

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,980
One common diagnostic is to check the scope of the content question items (CQIs), otherwise known as wh-items.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,420
Wide scope readings of CQIs are associated with indexical shift, while narrow scope readings are associated with quotation.

5
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:41,400
This diagnostic has been used to distinguish quotation and non-quotation across many indexically shifting languages, including Uyghur, a Turkic language with mandatory personal pronoun shift.

6
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,220
In this presentation, I will discuss novel data collected with a Uyghur speaker in the United States which shows

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,290
a) That Uyghur is a typical Partial Null Subject (or PNS) language except that it allows non-controlled embedded subjects to drop,

8
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:12,390
b) That Uyghur allows narrow scope readings of CQIs in places where wide scope is expected to be mandatory, and,  c) That these unexpected narrow scope readings do not allow non-controlled embedded subjects to drop.

9
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:25,770
I argue that these facts can be explained by assuming that a) Uyghur C-heads without a Force Phrase projection license third person subject drop, regardless of control, which explains this first observation,

10
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:34,230
and b) that Uyghur allows embedding of Force Phrases, which forces narrow scope interpretation of CQIs and prevents non-controlled subject dropping

11
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:45,930
The analysis will look like this: First I will argue that Uyghur is a PNS language, then I will discuss the CQI Scope Diagnostic for quotation.

12
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:56,460
After this I will discuss how CQI scope and null subjects interact in Uyghur, after which I will discuss my proposal to explain their unexpected interaction.

13
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:10,710
Holmberg (2009) describes the properties of PNS languages as follows: In these languages, subjects cannot be dropped unless: they have a generic interpretation, in which case they must be dropped,

14
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:19,590
they are controlled by an antecedent in a higher clause, in which case dropping is optional, and in some languages like Finnish, first and second person subjects can freely drop.

15
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,630
Now we'll look at Uyghur and see if it makes the cut.

16
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:42,060
Uyghur allows first and second person subjects to drop freely as seen in (5) and (6), where "men" and "sen" can be dropped, respectively, while for (7), even with a clear discourse referent in the previous sentence, matrix clause third person subjects such as the "u" must be overt.

17
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:51,990
Uyghur has mandatory third person dropping when the subject is generic, as in (8), where the third person subject "ular" is banned.

18
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,540
Additionally, third person subjects controlled by an antecendent, such as "u" controlled by "Ayishe" in (9), can optionally drop.

19
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,090
Given these facts, it seems that Uyghur is a Partial Null Subject language.

20
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,870
However, there is one place where Uyghur differs from typical PNS languages, and that's in (10).

21
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:24,330
In (10), "u" is the subject of the embedded clause, but is not coreferent with the matrix subject "Tursun", as a result, there is no referent in this sentence which can control "u".

22
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:35,820
If "u" is to be interpreted as non-generic and is not controlled, we would expect it to be mandatorily overt in a PNS language, and yet here it is optionally null.

23
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,770
This is a puzzle that we will deal with later on, specifically in Slide 15.

24
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:50,550
Now onto CQI scope. The CQI scope diagnostic comes out of the idea that Indexical Shift is unique from Quotation,

25
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,670
in that while Quotation is a black box, where no operations between the quotation and the matrix clause can occur,

26
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:12,570
Indexical shift allows free movement and licensing between the complement clause and the matrix. Under the shifty operator approach, indexical shift is caused by an operator which rewrites the referent of indexical items, but has no effect on opacity otherwise.

27
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:24,510
This opacity only implies a one way relationship, in which Quotation necessarily implies Narrow Scope interpretation of CQIs, but the converse is not necessarily true.

28
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:33,030
In fact, narrow scoping CQIs can be licensed by resultative and rogative predicates, such as "know" and "wonder" in (12).

29
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:47,400
Interestingly, quotations seems to enforce an intensional reading of the complement, such as in (13), where "say", a resultative predicate, is typically interpreted with an extensional meaning, but gains an intensional meaning under quotation.

30
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:59,040
The "true" diagnostic cannot tell us if something is quotational, only that if it is quotational it must have narrow scoping CQIs.

31
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:11,220
So instead, amongst much of the literature, there's an implicit assumption that is made about narrow scoping CQIs, namely that: Narrow Scope CQIs imply quotation if and only if:

32
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,690
a) the embedding predicate does not license an interrogative complement, or b) the embedding predicates licenses

33
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:37,950
licenses an extensionally interpreted interrogative complement, but the complement instead has an intensional interpretation. We can see instances of (14a) in (15a), where "think", an anti-rogative predicate can take an interrogative quotation, but not an interrogative non-quotational complement.

34
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:50,340
(14b) is instatiated in (15b), where "say", a resultative predicate, can license an intensional complement under quotation, but not otherwise.

35
00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:01,980
Now let's take a look at the interaction between null subjects and the interpretation of CQIs. For these examples I use the verb for saying in Uyghur,

36
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:13,230
though this also holds for anti-rogative predicates. If you are wondering why an extensional interpretation of these sentences are not available, look into my 2021 NELS poster which talks about this!

37
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:24,990
In (16), we have an overt third person subject in the embedded clause, not coreferent with the matrix subject. This sentence can have both a wide and narrow interpretation of its CQI.

38
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,130
For (17), where the third person subject is null, only the wide scope interpretation is allowed.

39
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:46,920
This completely follows if we continue to assume that a null third person is only licensed in non-quotational complements, and that in these instances, a non-quotational complement should result in a wide-scope, or at least extensional, interpretation.

40
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:57,930
While (16b) is fine as a quotation, (17b) is not, and because being a quotation is the only way, so far, to get the intended reading, it must be ungrammatical.

41
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,020
Uyghur interestingly, also allows accusative subjects. While accusative subjects are banned in matrix clauses, see (18),

42
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:21,330
they are perfectly fine as a replacement for their nominative counterparts in embedded clauses, such as (19). Shlkovsky and Sudo (2014) argue that the accusative subject is in SpecCP position, above any shifty operators.

43
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,970
One issue arises, however,

44
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:40,410
is that this sentence allows both wide and narrow interpretation of CQIs. Assuming that the narrow interpretation, in this case, can only arise from quotation, then we should not be able to license the accusative subject, which clearly is  banned from matrix clauses, as seen in (18).

45
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,310
One solution to this can actually be found in Etxepare (2010)'s analysis of Spanish "que".

46
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:57,750
Etxepare (2010) analyzes quotative "que" as a Force phrase embedder. The Force Phrase requires that the embedded phrase be interpreted with intensional meaning,

47
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:15,150
where CQI items necessarily have narrow scope. This allows intensional interrogative complements under both anti-rogative predicates and extensional predicates. In (20a), the presence of an embedded ForceP, marked by "que", licenses a narrow scope interpretation the CQI "quién",

48
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:24,840
without it, the CQI must either undergo raising, as Spanish is not a wh-in-situ language, or it will be ungrammatical, as shown in (20b).

49
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:38,790
In (21a), the presence of an embedded ForceP forces the complement of resultative "dijo" to have an intensional interpretation, as opposed to the extensional interpretation of a simple CP embedded clause as in (21b).

50
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:48,000
This looks exactly like how quotation affects English "say", but importantly, the embedded clause in (21a) is not a quotation.

51
00:08:50,490 --> 00:09:06,270
Thus I propose that Uyghur, like Spanish, allows for Force Phrase embedding. The mechanism works as follows: Matrix questions and intensional complements contain some item with an interpretable interrogative features, distinct from a [wh] feature,

52
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,090
following Suñer (1993). For content questions, this item is a CQI.

53
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,300
Interrogative Force-heads contain an uninterpretable interrogative feature, and will probe for a featured item.

54
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:26,130
LF movement of CQIs allows not only for a semantic interpretation, but also allows for this kind of feature checking.

55
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:35,280
The domain within which a Force-head can probe is ForceP, and so ForcePs block interrogative probes from c-commanding ForcePs.

56
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:49,020
And finally, as an addendum, C-heads which do not have a ForceP projection may license non-controlled null subjects, but C-heads with a ForceP projection require that the subjects of their TPs follow a strict PNS pattern.

57
00:09:51,570 --> 00:10:00,720
The CQI probe works as shown here, where both matrix and embedded CQIs are potential targets for a matrix Force-head if the embedded clause is only a CP.

58
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,830
A targeted embedded CQI will raise at LF all the way to the top, and be interpreted with wide scope.

59
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:18,270
If the embedded clause is a ForceP, then the probe from the matrix Force-head is blocked, and the embedded CQI is not a potential target for the matrix Force-head.

60
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:28,260
Instead, the embedded CQI may be targeted by the embedded Force-head, and thus raise at LF only to the embedded Force Phrase, causing a narrow scope interpretation.

61
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:39,960
The licensing of non-controlled subjects works as shown here, where non-controlled subjects are licensed only in embedded CPs, not embedded ForcePs,

62
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:49,470
this ensures that sentences with narrow scope interpretation of CQIs necessarily have an overt third person subject, if the subject is non-controlled and non-generic.

63
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:59,340
I've saved a discussion for the exact mechanism that causes Forceless C-heads to license null subjects in the appendix of these slides, and I'd be happy to talk about them after the talk.

64
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,080
But for now we are going to move on to how this analysis accounts for the sentences we've seen so far.

65
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:23,070
We see sentence (16) again here, where an overt third person subject is present. The wide scope interpretation can be derived through the embedding of a CP, which allows the CQI to raise to the matrix clause at LF, and allows, but does not enforce, a null subject.

66
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:34,410
The narrow scope interpretation can either be a quotation, as previously analyzed, or as a ForceP; in either case CQI raising is blocked and the overt subject is mandatory.

67
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,840
In (17), the wide scope interpretation is derived the same as (16), but with the choice to have a null subject instead of an overt one.

68
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:52,140
For (17b), neither ForceP nor quotation are allowed, as they would require an overt subject, and thus a narrow scope interpretation of the CQI is banned.

69
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:08,940
For (19), the wide scope interpretation is still fine: the embedded CP allows both LF raising of the CQI as well as subject-to-SpecCP raising, resulting in the accusative subject we see.

70
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:26,820
The narrow scope interpretation can only be derived with a ForceP, in which case the CQI is forced to have narrow scope interpretation, but the subject, still overt, can undergo movement into SpecCP and be realized as accusative. This is impossible in a matrix clause.

71
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:36,360
Finally, one more construction that appears in Uyghur is one in which a nominative and accusative subject seemingly both occur.

72
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:46,620
Major (2021) argues that this construction is derived through prolepsis rather than raising. The proleptic DP is generated in the matrix clause with accusative case,

73
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:57,300
while an embedded resumptive pronoun stays in the embedded SpecTP position and receives nominative case. This construction only allows a narrow scope interpretation of CQIs.

74
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:05,940
Etxepare (2010) argues that embedded ForcePs form small clauses with an overt or covert DP, which allows for C-selection by the predicate.

75
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:21,960
I propose that this structure is the same for Uyghur, and that the DP position may be filled with an overt proleptic DP, thus ensuring that this construction only occurs with ForcePs, enforcing a narrow scope interpretation in (22).

76
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:33,030
I hope that you come away from this talk with these ideas: One is that Uyghur is a PNS language, albeit with a strange twist, and another is that

77
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,500
Uyghur allows Force Phrase embedding, much like Spanish.

78
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:48,270
Additionally, I would like to say that we need to be careful with how we use our indexical shift diagnostics, as there are a number of ways that opacity can occur without the need for quotation.

79
00:13:49,020 --> 00:14:00,990
This brings me to my last point, which is that there may be a need to analyze quotational opacity as a confluence of opacities that occur in the left periphery, at various syntactic levels, rather than a single end-all-be-all.

80
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:07,890
Just in the same way that indexical shift was originally thought to be a phenomenon relegated to and inseparable from quotation,

81
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:23,760
it may be that other "quotational" effects, such as opacity of CQIs discussed here, actually arise from specific semantico-syntactic operators. Such a suggestion implies a potentially richer typology of the left periphery, and opens up a deeper discussion of what quotation actually is.

82
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,980
Thank you for listening.
